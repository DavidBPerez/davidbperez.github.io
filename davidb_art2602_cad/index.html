                The models here are one of the same, 
                both printed crabs with suppose to be attached moving limbs.
                Unfortunately due to the size (& possibly material) of the joints,
                both prints had unhappy results with the limbs or claws breaking.
                Another outcome is the clear model being flexibal with working limbs
                whereas the white model (most likely resin?) being a bit tougher
                needing more supports that got in the way & a leaking ooze??
