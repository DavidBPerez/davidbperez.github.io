        <h5>Artist Statement:</h3>
        Going into the project the key thoughts were: Mind. Body. Spirit. Mind represents the
        intellect or thought processes that go on behind the scene in a person’s head. Body represents the
        physical appeal or appearance of a person’s view on themself or how others perceive their looks.
        Spirit would be what makes a person who they are, as it is their personality and how they react
        around others or to themselves when nobody else is around.

        Going into this process from my point of view I took a similar yet somewhat unique
        approach. While this may be considered an art piece my main goal was to really visualize what is
        behind the idea of each “mirror”. The mind and spirit are non-physical and can be blurred in
        some way at times much like an art piece or two-dimensional paintings or cartoons put together
        in your mind & personality. Meanwhile, the body is physical and probably not as colorful for
        some individuals but definitely not as colorful as the mind or spirit (unless someone has a really
        dark perception of the world).

        Overall, each piece despite seeming like your usual photoshopped collection of images
        they all have a unique composition to them. For me, my mind is a painted mess of over-analysis,
        adoring-care, and geeky references (which might be prevalent across most of the pieces). My
        body is quickly reactive but a fragile shell of tallness, thinness, & flexibility while all being
        proportionally relational to the other. Finally, my spirit being more colorful and simplified than
        anything else but introvertedly collective, calm, and silent hiding a very charismatic tone
        somewhere within those traits.
